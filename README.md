Javascript Exchange-rate Calculator
This project is an exchange rate calculator/converter consisting of two rate converters. One converts from US Dollar(Base currency) to other currencies,
While the other converts multiple currencies but is only limited to 52 currencies

Assumptions Made: During the course of the project, we discovered that the API used (openexchange.org API) only converts from one currency
(the base currency which is US dollar) to other currencies, the base currency does not change. So it was decided we develope two converters
one that converts from US dollar to multiple currencies using the openexchange.org API and another converter that converts or accepts multiple 
base currencies using exchangerate-api.com API but only limited to 52 currencies excluding the Nigerian Naira.

Issues Faced: Integrating a single API that converts from multiple currencies or that accepts multiple base currency was a challenge.
